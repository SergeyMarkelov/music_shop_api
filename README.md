# second_api

My second api has written by using GoLang for my own practice

Api was created for music shop

I used Go 1.19, GORM library and Gin framework

API can make requests like Create, Read, Delete

For working with this API I recommend to use Postman

Destinations:

"/tracks" to GET all songs or for adding (POST) songs 

"/tracks/:id" to GET specific song or for deleting (delete) song
